# CRISPRaiCircuitsModeling
Package for modeling CRISPRai large scale genetic circuits and visualizing.

# Overview
Biomolecular interactions are hard to predict in CRISPRai-based genetic circuits due to resource management, and the indirect effect of gRNAs on each other. This reduces predictability of designing large genetic circuit
