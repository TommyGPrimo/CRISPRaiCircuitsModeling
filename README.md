# CRISPRaiCircuitsModeling
Package for modeling CRISPRai large scale genetic circuits and visualizing I/O responses for experimental perturbations

# Overview
Biomolecular interactions are hard to predict in CRISPRai-based genetic circuits due to resource management, and the indirect effect of gRNAs on each other. This reduces predictability of designing large genetic circuit

## Scope

*Version 1.0*
- Build CRISPRa biochemical genetic circuit implementation for modality one and modality two: tethered CRISPRa and gRNA guided CRISPRa and interactions for changing parameters
- Deliverable: Bioengineering 537 Computational biology, End of Autumn 2024.

*Version 1.1*
- Integrate experimental kinetic data for modality two interactions for potential autoregulator work
