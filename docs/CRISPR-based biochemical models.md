# CRISPR-based biochemical models
The ordinary differential equations (ODEs) used to generate the models in this package are referenced below. Originally written in Matlab and converted to tellurium.
This document briefly explains each biochemical model for ease of understanding each model.

## CRISPRa modality one
This model of CRISPRa is composed of an activator fused to the dCas9 machinery and allows to model input and output response for controlling concentration of molecules into the system.

## CRISPRa modality two
