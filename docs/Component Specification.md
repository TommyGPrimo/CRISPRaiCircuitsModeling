# Component Specification
This section contains software component specification for displaying data, managing data, inputs required and outputs provided, as well as interactions to accomplish use cases.
## Software components

### Class
- `crisprai_model.py`: the main class used for constructing the biochemical models and outputing/plotting results

### Functions

## Interactions

## Preliminary Plan
1. Import the package as `import crisprai_model as cai`
2. Define the type of genetic circuit using `cai` object, such as `my_CRISPRi_circuit = cai.defineCRISPRiCircuit()`
